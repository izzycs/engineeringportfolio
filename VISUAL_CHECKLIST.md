# Visual Verification Checklist

## What to Look For in the 3D Scene

### Monitors
- [ ] Glossy screen reflections (should catch environment light)
- [ ] Visible bezels around screen edges
- [ ] Chrome arm joints that reflect surroundings
- [ ] Brushed aluminum arm with subtle texture
- [ ] Matte black monitor backs (less reflective than fronts)
- [ ] Rubber grip ring on base

### Desk
- [ ] Wood grain appearance with warm brown color
- [ ] Darker edge banding around perimeter
- [ ] Black metal legs with matte finish
- [ ] Small adjustable feet at leg bottoms
- [ ] Brushed aluminum motor housing in center
- [ ] Dark vent slots on motor

### Keyboard & Mouse
- [ ] Anodized aluminum keyboard base (slightly reflective)
- [ ] Colorful RGB keycaps with subtle shadows between them
- [ ] Purple underglow reflection on desk below keyboard
- [ ] Matte black mouse (not shiny)
- [ ] Visible scroll wheel and button divider

### Desk Items
- [ ] Ceramic coffee mug (creamy color) with brown coffee inside
- [ ] Orange terracotta plant pot with rim detail
- [ ] Chrome headphone stand base (very reflective)
- [ ] Black plastic headphones with soft ear padding

### Chair
- [ ] Dark fabric seat and back (very matte, no shine)
- [ ] Chrome gas lift pole (highly reflective)
- [ ] Black plastic armrests with gray padding on top
- [ ] Gray rubber wheels with black cores
- [ ] Chrome support posts connecting back to seat

### Room
- [ ] Warm wood floor with visible plank lines
- [ ] Matte beige/cream walls (no shine)
- [ ] White semi-gloss baseboards (slight shine)
- [ ] White crown molding at ceiling
- [ ] Textured ceiling (not flat white)

### Bookshelf
- [ ] Rich walnut wood color (dark brown)
- [ ] Darker back panel
- [ ] Subtle dust appearance on shelves
- [ ] Books with colored spines AND visible page edges
- [ ] Orange basketball with texture

### Lighting & Reflections
- [ ] Environment reflections on chrome/metal parts
- [ ] Soft shadows under objects (if quality is high)
- [ ] Purple/blue accent lighting from sides
- [ ] RGB LED strips cycling colors
- [ ] Natural daylight feel from above

## Material Realism Indicators

### Metals Should:
- ✓ Reflect environment strongly (chrome)
- ✓ Show brushed texture (aluminum)
- ✓ Appear dark and matte (matte black metal)

### Plastics Should:
- ✓ Have slight shine (glossy) or no shine (matte)
- ✓ Look solid and uniform
- ✓ Show subtle environmental reflections

### Fabrics Should:
- ✓ Be extremely matte (no reflections)
- ✓ Look soft and non-uniform
- ✓ Absorb light rather than reflect it

### Wood Should:
- ✓ Show warm brown tones
- ✓ Have moderate roughness
- ✓ Display subtle variations in color
- ✓ Minimal reflections

### Ceramic/Terracotta Should:
- ✓ Look slightly porous
- ✓ Have earthy colors
- ✓ Show some shine but not glossy

## Performance Check
- [ ] Smooth 60fps rotation (on desktop)
- [ ] No lag when zooming
- [ ] Shadows render without flickering
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Fast initial load time

## Before/After Comparison Points

### Before:
- Flat, uniform materials
- Everything looked plastic-y
- No environmental reflections
- Basic colors without depth
- Missing detail elements (bezels, trim, etc.)

### After:
- Varied material properties
- Realistic metal reflections
- Proper roughness/metalness values
- Rich color depth from lighting
- Added detail geometry everywhere
- Environment mapping for realistic reflections
- Layered materials (glass over screen, etc.)

**TIP**: Toggle between quality settings to see shadow improvements!
**TIP**: Click on monitors to zoom in and see screen glass reflections up close!
**TIP**: Rotate around the desk to see how chrome reflects the environment!
